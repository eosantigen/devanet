# DevaPlan

Self-study plan in Software Development, Cloud Engineering and SRE.

_Since September 2022_  


## Objectives

- This plan builds on top of my technical school curriculum, as well as on the knowledge I've gained through my job.

- My early 20s at the technical school were immature and insufficient as compared to how my mindset evolved up until my mid-30s.

- Learning is an ever-evolving process

- Be better at my favourite job as DevOps & Cloud Engineer and potentially extend it by being able to get more involved with software development projects as well

- Because I enjoy creating and managing stuff - like a child playing with Lego
